#Qapture [logo]: https://github.com/Warzecha/Qapture-app/blob/master/assets/images/nice_logo3.png ""
Qapture is a free and open-source productivity tool that allows you to take screenshots easier. 
You can crop captured image in seconds not bothering using other image editing software!

Currently the default shortcut is Ctrl + Insert (Command on mac). You can manually change it in the source code.
I'm yet to find a way to use PrintScreen as a shortcut...
